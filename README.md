# Vector-Data-Compression-based-space-division

# Vector data
  It consist of shap files along with the both direction and magnitude of a data
  
# Compress vector data by applying "Grid filter"
----> by my own algorthem overall half of similer data will truncated

----> size will be half of the original
# need to improve
----> optimize my algorthem to improve better aprozimate ouput.
